## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Gide VSCode fork (or compatible VSCode version)
- Railway-hosted coding agent endpoint
- Node.js and npm for development

### Setup

1. **Configure Agent Endpoint**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)
   export GIDE_AGENT_ENDPOINT="https://your-railway-app.railway.app/api/agent"
   
   # Option 2: VSCode Settings
   # Go to: File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Gide Coding Agent
   # Set "Agent Endpoint" to your Railway URL
   ```

2. **Install Extension**
   - Place the extension folder in your VSCode extensions directory
   - Reload VSCode
   - The extension will activate automatically

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`)
   - Run "Gide: Open Coding Agent Panel"
   - Test connection to your Railway agent

## Usage

### Opening the Agent Panel

1. **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac)
   - Type "Gide: Open Coding Agent Panel"
   - Press Enter

2. **Direct Command**: Use the command `gide-coding-agent.openPanel`

### Using Context Modes

The extension provides four context modes to control what information is shared with the agent:

- **None**: No context sent (most private)
- **File**: Current file name and language
- **Selection**: Current file, selected text, and cursor position
- **Workspace**: Workspace name and file structure information

### Code Suggestions

When the agent provides code in responses, you'll see a "üìã Code Actions" button that allows you to:

1. **Extract Code Blocks**: Automatically detect code in responses
2. **Insert at Cursor**: Place code at your current cursor position
3. **Copy to Clipboard**: Copy code for use elsewhere
4. **Create New File**: Open code in a new VSCode file

### Quick Code Insertion

For rapid code insertion from selected text:

1. Select text containing code suggestions in any editor
2. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)
3. Run "Gide: Insert Code Suggestion"
4. Choose from extracted code blocks

### Context Refresh

The extension automatically updates context as you work, but you can manually refresh it using the "üîÑ Refresh Context" button in the agent panel.

### Basic Usage

1. **Open the Agent Panel**
   - Use Command Palette: "Gide: Open Coding Agent Panel"
   - Or use the keyboard shortcut if configured

2. **Start a Conversation**
   ```
   Example requests:
   - "Create a function to sort an array of objects by name"
   - "Explain this code: [paste your code]"
   - "Find the bug in this function: [paste your code]"
   - "Optimize this algorithm for better performance"
   ```

3. **Review and Apply Responses**
   - Agent responses include generated code and explanations
   - Copy code directly from the response
   - Ask follow-up questions for clarification

### Advanced Features

#### Context-Aware Requests
The agent can use context from your current workspace:
- Current file information
- Selected text
- Workspace root directory

#### Conversation History
- All conversations are saved during the session
- Clear history when needed
- Scroll through previous interactions

#### Error Recovery
- Automatic retry on network failures
- Graceful handling of agent downtime
- Clear error messages with suggested actions

## Configuration

### Extension Settings

Access via: `File ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Extensions ‚Üí Gide Coding Agent`

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `gide-coding-agent.agentEndpoint` | Railway agent endpoint URL | `""` |
| `gide-coding-agent.requestTimeout` | Request timeout in milliseconds | `30000` |

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `GIDE_AGENT_ENDPOINT` | Primary agent endpoint configuration | `https://your-app.railway.app/api` |

### Context Mode Configuration

The extension supports four context modes that you can select in the UI:

- **None**: No context shared with the agent
- **File**: Shares current file name and programming language
- **Selection**: Shares selected text, cursor position, and file info
- **Workspace**: Shares workspace name and project structure

### Security Configuration

For enhanced security:
- Use environment variables instead of VSCode settings for endpoints
- Regularly rotate any API keys used by your Railway service
- Monitor agent requests through the conversation history
- Use "None" context mode for sensitive codebases

## Railway Deployment

### Agent Backend Requirements

Your Railway-hosted agent should implement:

#### API Endpoint
```
POST /api/agent
Content-Type: application/json

Request Body:
{
  "id": "unique-request-id",
  "request": "user's natural language request",
  "context": {
    "currentFile": "optional-file-path",
    "selectedText": "optional-selected-text",
    "workspaceRoot": "optional-workspace-path"
  }
}

Response Body:
{
  "id": "same-request-id",
  "response": "agent's response text",
  "success": true,
  "metadata": {
    "model": "gpt-4", // optional
    "tokensUsed": 150, // optional
    "processingTime": 1500 // optional
  }
}
```

#### Error Responses
```json
{
  "id": "request-id",
  "response": "Error message for user",
  "success": false,
  "error": "Technical error details"
}
```

### Deployment Example

```bash
# Deploy to Railway
railway login
railway new
railway add
railway deploy

# Set environment variables
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
railway variables set MODEL_NAME=gpt-4
```

## Security

### Input Sanitization
- All user input is sanitized before processing
- HTML entities encoded for safe display
- URL validation for endpoint configuration
- File path sanitization for security

### Network Security
- HTTPS-only communication
- No hardcoded API keys or secrets
- Request timeout protection
- Error message sanitization

### Privacy
- No local data storage of conversations
- No telemetry or analytics
- No data sharing with third parties
- User controls all data flow

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Configuration Required" Error
- **Cause**: Agent endpoint not configured
- **Solution**: Set `GIDE_AGENT_ENDPOINT` environment variable or configure in settings

#### "Connection Failed" Error
- **Cause**: Network issues or agent downtime
- **Solution**: Check network connection and Railway app status

#### "Request Timeout" Error
- **Cause**: Agent response taking too long
- **Solution**: Increase timeout in settings or check agent performance

#### React/UI Errors
- **Cause**: JavaScript errors in the webview
- **Solution**: Use "Try Again" button or reload the extension

### Debug Mode

1. Enable VSCode Developer Tools
2. Open webview developer console
3. Check console logs for detailed error information
4. Report issues with log details
